# Password-Cracker
This cracker stores an unknown user-inputted password and implements a brute force attack which matches each combination to the password until it finally reaches the right one.
Passwords having four characters (numbers, letters, combinations) or less can be cracked almost instantly, while longer passwords, due to exponentially increasing sets, take from a few minutes to hours or even days to crack.
A basic GUI has been created using tkinter for python. Have fun cracking your friend's passwords!
